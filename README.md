# Potta Paatt

## ❓ Problem (that no one had)

People around the world were already using Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and a dozen other polished, functional music players.  
They were happy. Life was good. Nobody was begging for another broken, unstable, single-song React app.

## ✅ Solution (that no one asked for)

We built **Potta Paatt** — a glorified `<audio>` tag wrapped in React, with some questionable CSS, unreliable volume control, and a UI that makes you wonder *why?*

## 🧨 Features

- 🎵 Plays... something (if the file loads).
- 🔉 Volume control that pretends to work.
- 💀 No playlists. No scrubbing. No logic.
- 🧠 Written in React for no architectural reason.
- 🎨 Styled with whatever CSS was nearby.
