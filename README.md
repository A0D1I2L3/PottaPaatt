## Basic Details

### Team Name: **Kandam Bois**

### Team Members

* Team Lead: Adwaith Shameer– GEC Thrissur
* Member 2: Adil Haneef MK – GEC Thrissur

### Project Description

A gloriously dysfunctional React-based music player that turns basic audio playback into a mildly infuriating experience.
From unlocking songs with drag puzzles to using a Dino game for play control — it's less of a product and more of a cry for help.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People were satisfied with Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.
No one wanted a janky, feature-deprived, borderline-unusable music experience.
So naturally, we made one.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

**Potta Paatt** solves this non-problem with:

* A `<audio>` tag disguised as a React app
* A Dino game that controls playback (die = silence)
* A Plinko-based volume control system you’ll hate
* Absolutely zero sensible UX decisions

---

## Technical Details

**Software:**

* **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
* **Frameworks:** React 
* **Libraries:**`react-dnd` 
* **Build Tools:** npm


### Implementation

#### For Software:

**Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A0D1I2L3/PottaPaatt.git
cd PottaPaatt
npm install
```

**Run**
```bash
npm start
```

That’s it. Then hope the song loads and the Dino survives.
