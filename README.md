### Project Description

React based music player that allows you to do everything EXCEPT actually listen to music.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People were satisfied with Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.
We could'nt have that. SO we built something no one would willingly use. 
And we're proud of it.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

**Potta Paatt** solves this non-problem with:

* A Dino game that controls playback (die = silence)
* A Plinko-based volume control system you’ll have a lot of fun using.
* Absolutely zero sensible UX decisions

---

## Technical Details

**Software:**

* **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
* **Frameworks:** React 
* **Libraries:**`react-dnd` 
* **Build Tools:** npm


### Implementation

#### For Software:

**Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A0D1I2L3/PottaPaatt.git

```

Now you get to listen to songs. Congrats!
